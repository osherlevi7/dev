# Saasform Cloud

[Saasform Cloud](https://saasform.dev) is our hosted version of Saasform. It's how we make money and can support the open source project.

Saasform and Saasform Cloud share the same data model, so you can easily port your data to and from Saasform Cloud at any time.

For example, if you need to import existing users from your own database into Saasform, we highly encourage you to use the open source version first, so you can verify that any integration is working smoothly, and only at the end switch to Saasform Cloud. Of course, we're more than happy to assist you in any phase of the integration.

We're currently onboarding beta customers to Saasform Cloud. You can sign up for updates at [saasform.dev](https://saasform.dev).
